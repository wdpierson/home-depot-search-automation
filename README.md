# home-depot-search-automation
This Python script uses the Scrapy.py framework to automatically search and retrieve the names/prices of the top 3 search results for all provided search items. This script is useful for quick hardware price estimating for any given construction job.

The script can be ran in two ways:

1.) Through a terminal. The argument this script uses is "search_items".

2.) Through the given VBA macro in Excel. Ensure the VBA code points to where the script is installed. Put all search items into the same column, highlight these cells, then click the macro button.
